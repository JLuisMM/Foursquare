Coding Challenge

- When a search returns results, these should be displayed in a list format. Each list item should provide, at a minimum, the name of the place (e.g., Flitch Coffee), the category of the place (e.g., Coffee Shop), the icon from the response, the distance from the center of Seattle (47.6062° N, 122.3321° W) to the place, and whether the place has been favorited by the user. Clicking a list item should launch the details screen for that place.

- When a search returns results, the main screen should include a Floating Action Button. Clicking the Floating Action Button should launch a full-screen map with a pin for every search result. Clicking a pin should show the name of the place on the map, and clicking on the name should then open the details screen for the given place.

- The details screen for a place should use a collapsible toolbar layout to show a map in the upper half of the screen, with two pins -- one, the location of search result, and the other, the center of Seattle. The bottom half of the details screen should provide details about the place, including whether or not the place is favorited, and should include a link to the place’s website (if it exists). Clicking this link should open an external Intent to a browser installed on the device.
